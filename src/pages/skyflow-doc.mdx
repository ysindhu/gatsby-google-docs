You can use this guide to start using Skyflow?s APIs. If you?re setting up Skyflow for your team or business, check out our guide on [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.skyflow.com/developer-portal/how-tos/how-to:-author-a-policy-and-control-access-to-your-vault/) which will help you add teammates to your account and manage their permissions. By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

* Create a vault that you can use to securely store and protect your sensitive data.

### **Before you begin**

Log in to your Skyflow account. If you don't have one, click to [request one here](https://skyflow.com/contact_sales).

### **Create a vault**

*Vaults* are data storage units where you can store your application?s sensitive data. Skyflow vaults come with several privacy-preserving mechanisms out of the box, such as polymorphic encryption and de-identification, built to keep your data secure. Skyflow APIs enable you to interact securely with the data.

To create a vault, log into your Skyflow account and go to the Vault Templates tab in Skyflow Studio, as shown below:

*Vault Templates* define the high-level schema of the vault, including the fields and their relations. For instance, the Customer Identity vault comes packaged with all the sensitive fields a business would typically want to collect about a customer (email, phone number, and so on). Skyflow has a few predefined templates to choose from based on popular use cases.

Select a template and click Create. If you have multiple workspaces, select a *Workspace* to create the vault in.

Upon creating the vault, you?ll be taken to the *Vault Browser*. The Vault Browser lets you manage the data in the vault. Note, your newly created vault will be empty to start.

### **Create a Service Account**

*Service Accounts* provide secure channels of communication between your application and your vaults. To create an API Service Account for your vault, follow the steps below:

##### **Prerequisites**

* You must be a Vault Owner on a vault to create a service account

* Install Python 3.5 or later.

* Install PyJWT, requests and cryptography libraries

##### **Step 1 : Create an API Service Account and assign a role to it.**

* Navigate to the settings tab and select a vault for which you would like to create a service account from the drop down list on the left.

* Select ?Service Accounts? under the IAM section, and then click on ?New Service Account?

* Enter a name and description.

* Assign the service account a Vault Owner role from the drop down menu and click ?Create.? You can also assign any other role instead of the Vault Owner role in this step.

* Upon clicking Create, a *credentials.json* file will be downloaded to your local machine. Store this file securely as it contains a private key that will be used to sign your JWT bearer token.

Here is an example of the credentials.json file:
```json

{

"clientID": "client_id",

"clientName": "Customer support agent web  app",

"tokenURI": "token_uri",

"keyID": "your_key_id",

"privateKey": "private_key"

* }

```

Note: The Workspace URL and the Vault ID mentioned in the service account page will be required as URL paths when integrating with vault APIs.
